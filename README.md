Often during the contest , its servers are so overloaded that our submission take a long time to get verified by the judge and our time is wasted in checking for result again and again. This extension aims to save this time by automating the process of fetching the result and informing you as soon as the result is available so that you can move on to solve the next question and not worry about whether the result has been passed by the judge or not.
